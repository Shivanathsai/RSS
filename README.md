# RSS
Nodejs Project for fetching RSS Feed


Create an express API endpoint that takes a search keyword
Which fetches RSS feeds based on that keyword (from any third party service)
And displays in JSON format
As the keyword is changed and requests made again should bring back changed data in the response
To reduce the RSS feed hit, store the results in a DB and fetch from the DB when a keyword is requested again (use your choice of DB -- SQL/NoSQL)
A postman request for testing the API working would be a bonus, if not just a browser hit is fine.
